## Implementation

### Infinite Background

The infinite background is implemented using a scrolling technique where the background image is continuously moved to create the illusion of an endless environment. This is achieved by resetting the position of the background image once it moves off-screen.

### Platforms

Platforms are dynamically generated and positioned at random intervals to create a challenging and unpredictable gameplay experience. The platforms can have different properties such as moving, breaking, or disappearing to add variety to the game.

### Top Bar

The top bar displays important game information such as the current score, high score, and any active power-ups. It is updated in real-time as the player progresses through the game.
